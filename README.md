Assignment Instructions:
Week 1 Daily 2
Problem 1
Create a function to print the duplicates in a list of strings
public void findDuplicates(List<String> strings){};

Problem 2
Create a function to check if the string is a palindrome
public boolean checkPalindrome(String word){};

Problem 3
Create a function that will print
 "fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
 "buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
 "fizzbuzz" if the number is divisible by both
 and the integer for the rest
You can use a for loop for using the first 20 integers
public void fizzBuzz(int count){};

Problem 4
Create a function to check if the two strings are Anagrams
Eg COAT and TACO would be anagrams
public boolean findAnagram(String word1, String word2){};

Problem 5
Print a multiplication table from 1 to 10 using multidimensional array
Output
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
...
public void printTables(){};
